# Tasks — Birko.Framework

> ⚠ **Feature drift (3 groups, 76 items)** — **DV9 recomputed 2026-09-08** after this session
> filed 17 new tasks; the other two counts are carried from 2026-09-04 and are labelled as such.
> **DV9 ×54** (tasks carry `feature: FEATURE-014` but its `decisions.md` `→ Tasks` column never lists
> them — the ledger does not know about its own work; was ×31 on 2026-09-04, and **17 of the 23 new
> ones were filed on 2026-09-08**: TASK-305/306 and the 15 `SH-H` triage tasks TASK-308–322) ·
> **DV5 ×18** (every task in `_loose/` has no epic *and* no feature, so none appears in a feature row
> — carried from 2026-09-04, not recomputed) · **DV3 ×4** (TASK-285/286/287/288 sit under EPIC-014
> with `feature: null` while every sibling links to FEATURE-014 — a broken back-link; carried from
> 2026-09-04, not recomputed). Run `/roadmap --check` for the full audit, or `/tasks audit --fix` for
> the safe ones.
>
> ⚠ **DV7 was NOT recomputed in this pass and is not being reported as clean.** Spec staleness needs a
> `git diff` per area against `generated-at`, and most areas here glob **sibling repos** resolved
> through `source-commits` — a cost this dashboard refresh did not pay. The last measured value was
> **DV7 ×3** (`filter-expression-translation`, `bulk-filter-operations`,
> `unit-of-work-and-transactions`), owned by [[TASK-251]]. ⚠ And note that
> `filter-expression-translation` is now **also** the subject of [[TASK-308]] (P0, 7 findings), so its
> spec is both stale and about to change again. DV8/DV10/DV11 were clean at the last measurement: all
> 25 mapped areas exist on disk and carry `shaped-by-derived: true`.
>
> ℹ **Known false positive, left as-is:** EPIC-018 reads `in-progress` with all 4 tasks `done`. It is
> an area-of-concern epic giving `Birko.Web.Core` an owner, and closing it would recreate the orphaning
> it exists to prevent — the reasoning is in its own `EPIC.md` (§ *Why this epic stays `in-progress`
> with no open tasks*), which is why this dashboard no longer restates it.

- **EPIC-014** Code review — audit remediation — in-progress (99/183 tasks done)
  - [x] TASK-196 `x.Col.Date == value` matched zero rows on every input, every column, every day · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-197 `TimeOnly` had no column mapping — and after [[TASK-112]] it took the whole entity down · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-204 An index that could not be built took the entity's whole read surface with it — permanently · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-211 On-the-fly views are broken on PostgreSQL — and the error is swallowed, so they return an empty result · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-216 A filtered DELETE / UPDATE qualifies its `WHERE` with a bare table name, so every filtered write fails on PostgreSQL · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-231 `Birko.EventBus.Outbox.SQL` shipped complete but registered nowhere — unbuilt, untested, invisible · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-240 A transaction boundary that async writes actually honour, stated per provider · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-241 RavenDB never sets the document id from the entity Guid — delete is a silent no-op and update duplicates · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-242 Every bulk write escaped the transaction boundary, and on three providers it did so silently · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-244 Lazy schema-ensure runs before the store publishes its transaction boundary · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-246 A migration's `.Unique()` silently builds a NON-unique index on every SQL provider · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-248 MySQL cannot index an unbounded `string` column — and that is the canonical documented pattern · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-249 Four close-gate findings on TASK-245 — including a second injection sink its own rule pointed at · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-256 PostgreSQL's binary `COPY` cannot bind a UTC `DateTime`, and the test suite is green because its fixture avoids it · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-257 On MSSql an unlengthed `string` column becomes `TEXT`, so **no predicate on it works** · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-259 `SqlSchemaBuilder` publishes its connection onto a process-wide cached connector and never clears it · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-264 A migration's declared column metadata is dropped on the way to the connector · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-265 On MySQL a `[UniqueField]` or `[PrimaryField]` unlengthed string emitted `LONGTEXT`, so the table could not be created · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-266 Index keys that are still wrong after TASK-257: a `byte[]` column, and a composite too wide for the key limit · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-267 The project-local `verify-conventions` did not run at the close gate, again · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-273 `CompositeIndex` cannot express a filter predicate, so a unique index over a NULLABLE column is unusable on MSSql · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-275 `[UniqueField]` on a nullable column is an inline constraint, so on MSSql it rejects the second ordinary row — and no predicate can be attached to it · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-277 A write to a missing table reports SUCCESS on EVERY provider — `OnException` swallows it and `DoInit` does nothing · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-278 On SQL Server every limited read emits invalid T-SQL — `ReadFirstAsync` and paging both fail · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-281 A continuous aggregate cannot be created or refreshed inside a transaction — so it may never have worked through the runner at all · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-285 A `COUNT` of a missing table throws while a `SELECT` of the same table returns empty — the one read that answers 500 · null
  - [x] TASK-289 A throwing `OnSchemaEscapeDetected` subscriber reopens TASK-285 and destroys TASK-286's annotation · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-290 Name the mechanism behind the schema-ensure escape · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-292 The per-store transaction door remembers a schema-ensure that was rolled back · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-293 The escape "anomaly" is decided by a substring of the statement, so it fabricates anomalies · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-295 The escape and heal apparatus is SQLite-only: three providers record no created tables · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-296 SQLite connection pooling serves a stale schema image, so a freshly created table reads as missing · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-058 SqLiteConnector emits invalid AUTOINCREMENT DDL for non-primary-key increment fields (dual-key models) · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-131 Per-sub-repo `docs/specs/` trees — the aggregator's staleness guard cannot fire · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-150 `char?`, `TimeSpan` and `DateTimeOffset` have no column mapping — they now fail loudly instead of quietly · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] ~~TASK-205 A qualified `Table.Column` is emitted unquoted while `FROM "Table"` is quoted — PostgreSQL folds them apart~~ · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-208 DECISION: which of `Birko.Data.SQL.View` the spec map should cover — two fixes have now landed in the excluded part · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-210 `MongoDB.Driver 3.2.0` pulls two vulnerable transitive packages, and nothing reports it · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-217 `Update(Table, values, conditions)` builds its SET list from every column, so a partial update cannot work · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-227 `generated-at` always names the commit *before* the spec it stamps, so staleness is measured from too early · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-229 Two shared projects `using` a driver they do not declare — and three sources disagree about whose job it is · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-230 The remaining vulnerable transitives — 7 advisories across 37 of 246 projects · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-232 DECISION: the lock contract meant three different things — split the durations, keep session semantics · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-234 38 more shared projects use an external package they never declare · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-237 `RecurringJobScheduler` duplicates every job per worker — wire leader election · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-243 On MySQL, a store's first operation inside a boundary silently commits that boundary · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-245 Index DDL every provider accepts — MySQL rejected the clause, PostgreSQL could not resolve the columns · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-247 `SqlSchemaBuilder`'s raw-SQL fallbacks emit index DDL that two providers reject · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-250 A spec source glob is not a git pathspec, so the staleness check never saw 124 files · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-251 Regen the three wide-surface spec areas DV7 still reports · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-252 Six latent per-provider gaps found while closing the index-DDL thread · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-253 The migration hypertable emitters carry the same identifier defect — and one bypasses the DDL funnel · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-254 A hypertable conversion that cannot succeed now bricks the store instead of degrading · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-255 `BuildContinuousAggregateSql` still hardcodes `time` — CR-H070 unfixed in the method next door · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-258 `retryWhenOwned` claims to preserve each provider's retry policy, and nothing asserts that it does · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-260 `CreateContinuousAggregate` takes two raw SQL fragments that cannot be contained · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-261 `GetChunkInterval` reads a catalogue column TimescaleDB removed in 2.0 · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-262 The migration emitters' identifier rules assume this framework created the object — twice over · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-263 There is no way to persist an instant with its offset — the timezone-aware column type is mapped but unreachable · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-268 Two small SQL field-mapping gaps found while typing MSSql's string columns · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-269 Nothing reports a column whose stored type no longer matches what the model declares · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-270 `DataBase.GetConnector` shares one connector process-wide, and three separate features have put per-caller state on it · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-272 An entity cannot say which schema it lives in · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-274 The second index lane dropped `Sparse` in all six builders — and three of them created no index at all · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-276 One test in `Birko.Data.SQL.Tests` fails about 10% of full-suite runs, and its identity was never captured · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-279 `BuildCompressionPolicySql` keeps CR-H070's `orderByColumn = "time"` — the half of the remedy that was a compatibility artefact · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-280 `IsHypertable` and `GetChunkInterval` ignore the schema half of the qualified name TASK-262 taught them to accept · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-283 A throwing `OnIndexCreationFailed` subscriber defeats TASK-204's degrade and bricks the entity · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-284 An empty `startOffset` silently widens a refresh policy to all of history — and the escape hatch that relies on it is untested · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-286 Date every `CREATE TABLE`, so "created and then missing" stops being unprovable · null
  - [x] TASK-287 The count path swallows TASK-286's escape annotation, so the instrument is blind where it is needed · null
  - [x] TASK-288 A table that vanishes under an initialised store never comes back — every write 500s until restart · null
  - [x] TASK-294 A count that hits lock contention is a 500, while a count of a missing table is `0` · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-298 A migration can declare a column default, and no connector emits one · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-303 A composite `PRIMARY KEY (a, b)` cannot be declared at all, and TimescaleDB needs one · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-304 `AbstractDatabaseModel`'s `[UniqueField]` on `Guid` forbids the composite key TASK-303 just enabled · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-305 The default `RetryPolicy` is `None`, so every retry path in the SQL layer is inert — decide whether it should be · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-306 Every live provider suite runs ~19 parallel classes against ONE database, and two different failures follow · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-144 `RuleSpecification` and `RuleExpressionConverter` are two translators of one rule model · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-146 Nothing pins that the async repository has no connector-bypassing read · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-226 Per-sub-repo `docs/specs/` trees for the 4 single-repo areas (and the 64 unspecced projects) · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-233 DECISION: the CosmosDB span-`Contains` rewrite may now be redundant — the SDK fixed it upstream · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-236 A per-backend verdict on locking for the six job backends without a provider · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-238 Seven `Birko.Data.Sync.*` projitems carry a `ProjectReference` to another `.projitems` · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-239 Packages declared that .NET 10 already provides — `NU1510`, the mirror image of TASK-234 · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-271 The TimescaleDB migration emitters bypass the connector for a reason that no longer exists · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] ~~TASK-282 The TimescaleDB migration emitters bypass the connector — an option TASK-259 reopened and nobody owns~~ · FEATURE-014
  - [x] TASK-291 `EnsureSchemaAndReport` rewraps a cancellation as a bare `Exception`, so a client that hung up becomes a 500 · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-299 `FieldDescriptor`'s three index properties are read by nothing, in any backend · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-300 A skill instruction is not an enforcement mechanism — only a hook cannot be skipped · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-301 `Birko.EventBus.Outbox.SQL` is in the build and in no documentation index · FEATURE-014
  - [ ] TASK-302 The SQL test suites have leaked ~90,000 temp directories, and every teardown swallows the failure · FEATURE-014
